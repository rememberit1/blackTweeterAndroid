*Native YouTube*

Giving you quick access to a friends video is important, I know that, and with Talon, it is only a swipe away.

Any tweets that contain a YouTube video will not only show a thumbnail on your timelines, it will also automatically open them in the native YouTube viewer when you open up that tweet. Just swipe to the left of the tweet and access that video right from the app.

Note that you have to have the YouTube app installed on your phone for this funtionality to work.
