*In-app Browser*

This app features a unique in-app browser that allows you to quickly view and switch webpages that are contained in a tweet.

I say it is unique because, unlike some other apps, a full screen version is just a swipe away on any tweets! Simply swipe to the left of your tweet on a status containing that link and it will automatically load what was contained there. If that status has more than one link? No problem! A simple drop-down menu will allow you to easily navigate between any of the web pages contained in the status.

If you prefer the "Windowed Advance" feature, but want to view those webpages in a full-screen browser from within the app, once again, it is as simple as a click. Clicking any links on the body of a tweet will automatically take you to a full screen version of the browser where you can navigate, or open the page in your systems default web browser.

Quick and seemless web viewing. That's how it should be done.
