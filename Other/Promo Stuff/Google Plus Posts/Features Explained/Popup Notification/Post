*Popup Window*

I want to view my friends tweets... but I don't want to completely leave my game either... Hmm, what to do??

With Talon, you don't have to worry about that, when your timelines are refreshed and the notification is given, on Jelly Bean and above, a button will appear on that notification to open the timelines in popup mode! It won't have quite all the functionality, but for a quick view and refresh of your timelines, it is a great way to get the information, then get right back to running through the woods in Temple Run!

Try it out the next time your timeline does an auto-refresh in the background!

Our popup windows: inspired by Paranoid Android's Halo and Facebook's Chatheads, perfected in Sliding Messaging.
