*Favorite Users*

Talon offers a very simple and clean way to keep track of the people you like to hear from most.

Without the hassle of digging through timelines or profiles, this app will throw a notification whenever a user that you have marked as "favorite" sends a new tweet. You will then easily be able to view that tweet to find out what's on their mind! It will also alert you with a notification in the "Interactions Drawer" if you have it enabled by turning on the "Talon Pull" feature.

Simply enable it from notification settings and it will notify you of their tweets whenever your timeline goes through the background, auto-refresh phase.
