*Amazing Visuals and Animations*

From the very start, Talon aims to amaze and excite you by killer animations and UI extras.

You will notice tons of extra little things to make your experience even better, including:
- a hiding action bar
- interactable toast bar
- transparent navigation and status bars on KitKat

Every part of the UI has been engineered to provide you with the best experience, most screen space, and neatest features.
