*Do Not Disturb and Night Modes*

Talon features an easy way to make your nights go smoother and easier. 

The *night mode* will let you automatically set a time when you want the app to switch to a darker theme, for easier viewing during the darker hours of the day. Easy on the eyes, easy on you! Please note though that just opening and closing the app isn't going to automatically trigger the switch. Normally, this will only resume the app, so to get it to switch themes, you will have to switch activities (an example would be just going into settings, or any of the other links from the left side, main drawer). The theme will also refresh automatically if you open the popup from the notification. This is just something to be aware of because of the way that we theme the app.

*Do not disturb mode* on the other hand, focuses solely on notifications and managing them while you don't want to be disturbed. Set it for your usual bedtime and don't worry about the notification light going off or the screen coming on waking you up! It will still do the background refreshes as it should, but it won't post a notification for you to be distracted by. Cool huh!

Find the night mode under "Theme Settings" and do not disturb under "Notification Settings"!
