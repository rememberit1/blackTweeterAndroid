*In-line Interactions* (Replies, favorites, and retweets)

See something you like, but don't want to take the time to open the full tweet just to favorite a status? Well, you don't have to with Talon!

This app features in-line interactions that are access either via a long click on the tweet or a short click on the tweet (depending on your settings under "Advanced Settings") on your main timelines. Easily favorite, retweet, or reply to a user's status without leaving anything behind.
