*Windowed Advances*

Screens on phones are huge now. It is something we all know and all love. Sometimes you may just prefer speed and you don't need to use that giant screen though. 

By turning on the "Advance Windowed" feature under "Advanced Settings", any tweets or profiles that you open from the timelines will be thrown up in an overlay window. This provides super quick access back to your timelines by just clicking outside the windows, which will close them down.

Sometimes you want to use that giant screen, sometimes you prefer speed... It's up to you, and with Talon, I let you choose for yourself!

Profiles do provide a little bit different functionality though, long clicking on a profile picture from one of the timelines will open that profile in the opposite orientation. So if you have it set to normally "advance windowed", but want to open a user's profile in full screen, you don't have to be confined to just one option!
